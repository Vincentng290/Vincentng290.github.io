		<h2>Northern Lights</h2>
		<p>2024, Digital, 15 in x 18 in</p>
		<p>This poster was designed from my love of the Northern lights. I wanted to create a piece that would showcase the beauty while explaining the audience what they are exactly. </p>
		<p>I wanted to gravitate the attention using imagery first so as the viewerâ€™s eyes are laid onto the piece, their eyes would move from left to right seeing the scientific name of the phenomenon. Pulling their eyes below, has the explanation behind how they are created and where they are found.</p>
